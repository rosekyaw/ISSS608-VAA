The Task\nThe task for take-home exercise 1 is to plot the population pyramid for 9 selected area in Singapore to illustrate the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level.\n\n\n2. The Data\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 from Department of Statistics, Singapore is used to plot 9 planning area.\n\n\n3. Step by Step Description\nThe final worksheet is published in https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yun.shwe.yee.kyaw/viz/Take-home_Ex01_16742356941600/Age-SexPyramid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n1\nLoad the data file respopagesextod2022.csv into Tableau\n\n\n\n2\nOpen a new worksheet and drag Age to Rows\n\n\n\n3\nSelect Sex and right click.

Different Types of Population Pyramid\nPopulation pyramids are useful in illustrating age-sex structure of the population. They also provide information about fertility rate, mortality rate and population growth trend.\nThere are three basic shapes of population pyramids.\nExpansive\nExpansive population pyramids are used to display the population that are growing and most of the populations are in younger age cohorts. Their typical pyramid shape has a wide base and narrow top. Expansive pyramids indicate high fertility, high mortality, low life expectancy, higher population growth rates.\nConstrictive\nConstrictive population pyramids are used to are used to display the population that are shrinking and most of the populations are in older age cohorts. They can often look like beehives and has narrow base. Constrictive pyramids indicate low fertility, low mortality, high life expectancy and ageing of population.\nStationary\nStationary, or near stationary, population pyramids are used to display the populations that are not growing and have equal distribution across age cohorts . They usually have rectangular that get narrower toward the top. Stationary pyramids indicate low fertility, low mortality and high life expectancy.\n\n\n5. Discussion\nThe top 9 most populated planning areas in Singapore are selected out of 55 planning area to do age-sex population pyramid in trellis display. By selecting 9 most populated areas, it can reveal more accurate population growth trend in Singapore,\nThe top 9 most populated planning area is as following.\n\nBedok\nChoa Chu Kang\nHougang\nJurong West\nPunggol\nSengkang\nTampines\nWoodlands\nYishun\n\nThe below picture is the final result of data visualization for 9 planning area.\n\nAs you can see from the picture above, Bedok and Jurong West area display the distinct constrictive population pyramid shapes while the others displays marginally constrictive population pyramid shapes. These plots also reveal that Singapore have low fertility, low mortality, high life expectancy and ageing of population. It also indicates that Singapore is a developed country with ease access of birth control and advanced health care facilities.\n\n\n6. Reference\nPopedadmin. (2022, October 21).

    "text": "1. The Task\nThe task for take-home exercise 2 is to critic one of my classmate’ work for take-home exercise 1 in terms of clarity and aesthetics. Then, the original design will be remade using the data visualization design principles and the best practices learned in lesson 1 and 2. The remade design is created using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.\n\n\n2. The Data\nThe same data from take-home exercise 1 is used. The data is extracted from Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 from Department of Statistics, Singapore.\nBelow are the steps taken to install packages, load libraries and import data.\n\nInstall packages and load libraries\nInstall tidyverse and ggiraph libraries to use for visualization.\n\n\nShow the code\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggiraph)\n\n\n\n\nImport data\nRaw data is imported from respopagesextod2022.csv and put into population_data data frame.\n\n\nShow the code\npopulation_data <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesextod2022.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Critique\nIn this section, the original design done by Prachi Ashani will be reviewed in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\nA trellis display with population pyramid is used to illustrate the demographic structure of Singapore for 9 planning areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity\n\nThe title is clear and informative and the caption is used to state data source. Each area has its own title to state the planning area and percentages of population for each age group are clearly displayed.\nThe order of Age Groups will be better represented in ascending order in upward direction since it is a common practice for population pyramid. It is also easier to categorize the type of population pyramid such as constrictive type if it is constructed using common practice.\nThe age can be displayed as per the data instead of grouping since the grouping of age can be subjective and can sometimes mislead the information.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe overall dsiplay is easy to understand and beautifully illustrated.\nAlthough using the different colors for each age category is aesthetically pleasing, it can distract the audience from grasping the data visualization. It is better to use the same color with different gradients to display the number of population.\nThe percentage can be displayed using the tooltip instead of putting it on the graph. The graph will be cleaner and easier to see from the audience perceptive.\n\n\n\n\n4. The Remake\nThe original design done by tableau will be remade using r with a few modifications for better visualization.\n\nData Wrangling\nThe data is prepared for plotting population pyramid . Firstly, the population_data is filtered for 9 most populous planning areas in Central Singapore by using filter function. Then, 0_to_4 and 5_to_9 values are replaced with 00_to_04 and 05_09 respectively to keep the age variable in ascending order by using str_replace function. Finally, the population data is grouped by using age, sex and population with summation of population for each category.\n\n\nShow the code\nPA_9 <- c(\"Tanglin\",\"Bukit Timah\",\"Downtown Core\",\"Newton\",\"Novena\",\"Orchard\",\"Outram\",\"River Valley\",\"Rochor\")\npopData_9 <- filter(population_data, PA %in% PA_9)\npopData_9$AG<-str_replace(as.character(popData_9$AG),\"^0_to_4$\",\"00_to_04\")\npopData_9$AG<-str_replace(as.character(popData_9$AG),\"5_to_9\",\"05_to_09\")\npopData_9_Group <- popData_9 %>% group_by(PA,AG,Sex)  %>% summarise(Pop = sum(Pop))\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Population Pyramid in Trellis Display\nAfter preparing the suitable data, the population pyramid is plotted using ggplot in trellis display setting for 9 central planning areas. The tooltip is used to displayed the total number of population for each age,sex category.\n\n\nShow the code\npyramidGH <- ggplot(popData_9_Group, aes(x=AG, y=Pop, fill=Sex)) + \n  geom_bar_interactive(data=subset(popData_9_Group, Sex==\"Females\"), stat=\"identity\",aes(tooltip = Pop)) +  \n  geom_bar_interactive(data=subset(popData_9_Group, Sex==\"Males\"), stat=\"identity\",aes(y=Pop*(-1),tooltip=Pop)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-4000,4000,2000),labels=abs(seq(-4000,4000,2000))) +\n  coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~ PA) +\n  labs(title=\"Population Pyramid for 9 most Populous Planning Areas in Central Area - June 2022\", x=\"Age\", y=\"Population\", caption = \"Data Source:Department of Statistics,Singapore (SingStat)\")\n\ngirafe(ggobj = pyramidGH )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Learning Points\nTake home exercise 2 serves as a reflection for take home exercise 1 since I can see the visualization from different perspective through peer review. It make me realize the importance of seeing the visualization from audience perceptive. Take home exercise 2 also helps me to improve my r coding skill through practice as well as more understanding about the functions/features of different library."
